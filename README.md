# Random Password Generator

## Description

The goal of this project was to be able to generate a completely random password that can meet a wide range of criteria. This was achieved by giving the user the ability to include any or all of the four variables, uppercase, lowercase, special characters and numbers, up to a maximum length of 128 characters.

## Usage

Upon clicking "Generate Password" on the webpage, the user will be prompted to enter a length for their password and then further prompted to select what type of characters they will be including in their password. finally, the password will be displayed in the box showing "Your Secure Password" from which it can be copied.
